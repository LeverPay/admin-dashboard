Leverpay is a responsive web application built with ReactJS and Styled-Components for displaying a dashboard and transaction page. The application is designed to help users manage their transactions and monitor their financial activities in real-time.

## Features

- Transaction Page: This page allows users to view their transaction history and filter transactions by date, category, and status.

- Responsive Design: The application is fully responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.

- Card Center: The Card Center page provides users with a comprehensive view of their registered credit and debit cards. Users can add, remove, or manage their cards from this page. Additionally, they can view card details, such as the card number, expiration date, and cardholder name, for easy reference.

- Messages: The Messages page serves as a communication hub for users. It allows them to receive important notifications, updates, and alerts related to their account, transactions, and any other relevant information. Users can mark messages as read, delete old messages, and take necessary actions based on the messages they receive.

- Contact: The Contact page provides users with access to important contact information, such as customer support phone numbers, email addresses, and physical addresses. Users can also find a list of frequently asked questions (FAQs) to quickly find answers to common inquiries. This ensures a seamless user experience by facilitating communication between the user and the support team.

Users can generate various reports, such as expense summaries, income trends, spending by category, and budget analysis. The reports help users gain a deeper understanding of their financial habits and make informed decisions to manage their finances better.

- Users: The Users page, accessible only to administrators or privileged users, enables managing user accounts within the application. Administrators can view a list of registered users, edit their profiles, reset passwords, and grant or revoke access permissions as necessary. This page is crucial for administrators to maintain control over the application's user base.

- Settings: The Settings page allows users to personalize their experience within the application. Users can modify their profile information, change account settings, update notification preferences, and manage security options like two-factor authentication. Customizable settings enhance the overall usability and convenience of the application for each user.
